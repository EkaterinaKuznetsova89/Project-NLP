# Project-NLP
The project was forked from https://github.com/cfenollosa/project-3-nlp/tree/master
This project builds a text classification model to detect whether a news headline is fake (0) or real (1) using a variety of NLP techniques including TF-IDF, Random Forest, and Transformer models (DistilBERT & BERT).

Objectives:
Preprocess and clean text data (headlines only)
Apply NLP vectorization (TF-IDF)
Train multiple models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
DistilBERT (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)
BERT (jy46604790/Fake-News-Bert-Detect)
Compare model performance
Output predictions for unseen test data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
